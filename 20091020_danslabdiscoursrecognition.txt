set in so and I want to correct or is accepting in that sense of system was an update soap then you have video of owning like we have 50 years mean depicting it with my friends in Loman than an adverb in Berlin and Los Angeles and laughing his book that this because I have friends living there know it's been and in Indiana Indiana is a tiny saw it arrived as you'd are wrestled at this writing articles on legal and ethical pollution and think it would invite inching down benefits a public and government piles but the image that that Bart and I don't know if he was called bar of this guard at the opening to the image he told me Sunday of mocking faces its sitting next of their particle accelerator and also not sure about shifted what do we do and the fact that I got this e-mail of a computer programmer who I don't know and said that after I sent him an e-mail via the programming there is after all that in which I drove around Dr. Gupta given around in users watched I don't know what I was watching on television but it says I was watching something on television Annan took overdrive in the world or look by mime type or I could just effect of forcing a global diamond world with easy I could pick all the time of my memories after each other one after the other after the other after the other so that I could actually ride this that Olden dreams we have had a future in the 20th century both the second world bar mass media ample culture that everything we could have come up with that it at this very moment in 2009 is more or less there a more miles and concisely put into words the role of the artist and intellectual at this moment and is everything fitting together and to my newly discovered distaste for science which very a much of fits into my power cord with phrase science has filled us accept you by being rocket science was the phrase which are not so much that it I think I used it already six guys in this race is probably a bar itself responsible for my desire to write the book which his goal life sciences field is Ed Bastien and I just said he would miss them with parts are pretty quite sure that no clue what his name is he was also so than the to say that because I wasn't thinking about parties faulting me in Oakland with him and he said while it if you have a question anyway if something is in you or outside of you that that's of course an very very Western and I add worthwhile question but all of this together days so this enabled me to sit at their at the table at the this Sunday and Belgrade via our power and up a pen and a possession and technology out of or related to reach over and and and and and later in the evening I even had its roof flickering them up in which I he and he did not know him a local local little up who really arrive in very for multi-right to think because writing is offered in thinking read the think they're very down knocking Gnostics apartment and you couldn't also very yeah while the track record with after reading the criticism that your and he does in thing to take from this root there for as a disruptive criticism oh I'll actually everybody and Richard Dawkins in particular and you know Richard Dawkins in a you wrote the book the selfish gene and the selfish meme and I spent the list I'm criticizing religion didn't serve religiously but a thing as a tribe of our articles of this business didn't want the thing is that doesn't do anything on the next that you could do something out of those makes that done in my case anyhow for an announcement in the example above Nixon for a finale starts getting less and less food receiver to fade out conceited coherence fading out the guts is in turmoil but not at work it's like because it's from friends normally like like a lap and are renewed fears starts fading out in a remote mountainous corner and are going to see if I can make in life and do it now because and use the best well executed right out of a sense of pride life in this a because what I didn't write down his wife doesn't make sense to have these at two to go out the whole world and then think I will world is your role right on and fashion on because I basically will go well the whole world that a so that there are no because I don't know actually I don't really don't know but the point is that I think that you that that the one thing you can ever do is that you can Judge somebody else on their motives and judge them by the own what he does and if if you make a big story like that and afraid when you're Richard Dawkins and the endeavor to make up a story like that always insult where people will end up being a part of her story and that in itself I think is very interesting and unnecessarily dangerous with if you want to be different so you can connect with you make these big stories about the world and do two things it again denies depending in the lives of people and will just say while I've explored about the world and all nice and will the people who don't fit in it introduce will not because we not thought of people with when that happens as if his big story of a world but if you felt people who are involved in the story and then you spend all your time try to be nice two people who are part of her story in Google while reading-and then you get and read most of her time picking how they think thinking the local mouth actually thinking about people that you don't even our impulse this also still is not a good ending she is and should or should I wish there was a who you that is a good question will in the main wish I have is people's that people would see a book about like this you may be saved Ring affected myself up for as long as you make divisions but if this longer to find something as not meeting another thing than people will pull up a lung will always be people will be saying people to go wrong or right an if you define things as of if if you say there are known to you know the all things are known for for Temple of a thing for simple you know if you make the the the the distinction between the objective and subjective than you immediately say for and then you can say things like all subjective literary critics already subject of vastness or these subjective conceptual artists pages if you just say what will be a subject of an alternative objective in their part of when they form they are something together than you can say I'll should like that than I really have to pay attention to what dancers are thinking what I guess that's the best conclusion that I've read that either doubted that this is the conclusion of course iron maiden and if you make a conclusion you basically to walk to offer everybody a reason that is well on the conclusion I had let go again that so that I should this is also my spec and then sit effective and typical going to be part of my revolution of the place at all times the Web phrase II and older phrase echoing look at the if if if if I can't dance then I better pay a lot of attention to what dances are thinking him from a
