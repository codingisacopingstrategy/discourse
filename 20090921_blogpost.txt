So you see in February I used the word ‘we’ all the time, even though I was just me. I had started hating the word I, because it sometimes seems like the only pronomen used on the internet (with exceptions: Rands uses ‘you’ all the time). One tendency, because it reinforces the individualism ‘my invariably irrelevant weblog’.

Shortly thereafter my head exploded.
