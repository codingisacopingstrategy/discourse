Why yes, that is a miracle. Of course there is only causality. But that causality actually produces something which works out for you and others, that is a miracle. Because it was never part of the deal.

I am an Ellen Lupton fanboy. So when people act as if Ellen Lupton does not have a clue, I get suspicious. Especially if they deem her naive and unreasonable. Because I have exactly the opposite opinion. When I read Lupton’s books I am astounded by the way in which she combines a technical and historical knowledge of her craft with both a profound theoretical understanding and a positive and inclusive attitude towards making a difference. Ellen name checks her Baudrillard and goes on to recommend the best ways to print your own t-shirt. I have wondered how her attitude has come about, since as far as I know the more books people read the more cynical and culturally pessimistic they get. Especially when they take their cues from continental schools of thought. It just so happened that a positive attitude is not part of the aesthetics of cultural sophistication.
