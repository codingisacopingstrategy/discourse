in the train
and the horse
and te man
with the cowboy hat
on the bicycle

We were busy with more or less exactly the same

The thinking body, the structure of thought processes, and the role physical objects play in our dealing with the world.

Posthuman not what we will become but what we can already become, a subjectivity that foregoes the I for retelling the self through the other. , which is in my opinion fragmented subjectivity inherent to flat societies  I brought in Nietschze’s concept of the s
uperman and its appropriation in the early 1970ies by David Bowie, but also Rimbaud’s ‘Je est une autre’

The world depicted

the world‘
  the body is a subset of the world
    the mind is a subset of the body
      the cognition is a subset of the mind
      the smell is a subset of the mind
      the hearing is a subset of the mind
      the touch is a subset of the mind
      the seeing is a subset of the mind
      the hearing is a subset of the mind

Senses are a treshold between the mind and the world
We don’t know the body directly, rather, the body knows the world.

This gap makes a need for the subject
