song: but my mind, cognition and bo-o-o-dy

the wall it did fall
it keeps falling again
i can replay the movement on my own screens
the screen of my computer and the eye of my mind
now the other walls will have to fall in our minds
and the other walls will have to fall between minds
it is time, and its time
and let time,
keep them rechanging

me i am will and forrest mixed up
and may be rain man but i never saw that
but without these others our identity is void
it’s the times, that keep rechanging
i am another, and another is me
please let go of your au-then-ti-ci-ty

now for some science
i will keep it concise
meaning is propelled forward, in-de-fi-ni-te-ley
please embrace the poststructural flux
because the times, will keep rechanging
‘anything’ goes, is anything ‘goes’
as the times, they are rechanging
i am another, and another is me
please let go of your authenticity
