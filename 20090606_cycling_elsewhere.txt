I cycle in another town, more large, more open. More cars and even more people, like me, on bicycles.
At the same time I can use my knowledge of a smaller town with biking traditions to be even more death-defying than the cyclists I overtake, as I accelarate past and zigzag inbetween the cars, across the Alexanderplatz, into the Memhardstraße, the Münzstraße, etcetera.
