There is freedom in

Cycling elsewhere

Everything is larger more open

(larger than life, larger than life as you knew it) 

More cars but even more

People—like me—on a bicycle

At the same time I can use my knowledge (style)

Of the smaller life past

(the Amsterdam bicycle knowledge (style))

To be even more death-defying than these others

—Like me—

Across them

Accelarate past the cars

Zig-zag inbetween (those)

And across the Alexanderplatz

into the Memhardstraße

the Münzstraße

etcetera
