There is no intellectual basis to believe that what you say is right or that what you want is good.
I used to be very concerned with this predicament in my work—how can you still say something if you do not believe you have any grounds to do so, how can you deal with the conflicting desires to say what is on your mind and say that it is nothing, or ultimately say nothing at all.

This concern has lessened, since I found that the very categories I was dealing with, truth and meaning, are not really things that are found, they are sensations that are produced. And they are produced regardless of your own epistemological beliefs. I found, not only is meaning a sensation, it is a sensation that can approach the ecstatic.

It times I understand everything 

I want to deal with truth as a self-substantiating mechanism, with understanding a self contained feedback loop. I want to chart and model the mental mechanisms of meaning.
In this light I see my work

my desire for awesomeness is an absolute desire: a desire with no other end than itself.

In my attempts to analyze my desire for awesomeness I got completely caught up in substantiating the desire. I found awesomeness to be the modern day equivalent of the sublime.

Charting and modeling the mental mechanisms of meaning.

I aim for my work to fit into a larger discourse on vanity, belief and epistemology. Which is also the reason why I choose media like photography and text that are not specific to visual arts. I would like to actively engage in the popular culture that formed me. I see how it could be both stimulating and disruptive. What is important to me though, is that it is not critical in the traditional sense of the word. Because critique is the position of the outsider—and I belief the artist is always on the inside.

then there was a version of that one where the sentence It times I understand everything was ommitted as was the last half sentence

I produce images and texts and I perform. 
I want my images to be 
my Bowie and Prince .

The combinations I make superficial and the profound.  
Explaining epistemology wearing shiny pants.

My work is not critical. I want to be on the inside.

I search for awesomeness. I found out wanting to deconstruct my desire for awesomeness only substantiated it. The closer I come to awesomeness, the more scary it becomes. I found awesomeness to be the modern day equivalent of the sublime. 

Exposing the circular reasoning.x

Now I want to deal with truth. At times I feel like I understand everything. It is surprising how little good that does in itself. I become enclosed in my self: truth is smaller than reality.

I hope to articulate such mechanisms in my texts and images and performances.
I want to show my desire for awesomeness. 
The processes I show are often closed loops. Investigating my desire for awesomeness means substantiating my desire for awesomeness.
There are less words than things.
There are times when I feel like I won the game of rhetorics.
I like tight pants and mathematics.

It is the process of understanding that . Understanding is like a drug.

I want to show my desire for awesomeness. 
I have an intense interest in epistomology and mathematical linguistics, but talking about that somehow only makes sense when I put on shiny pants. Meaning is performative.
