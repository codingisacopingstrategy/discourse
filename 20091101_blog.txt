If you ask an artist what is work is about, he or she might say he or she is producing reflections on art, or on his or her artistic practice, or maybe on the construction of identity. I feel that artists should reconsider truth. Sure, truth is just a word, but is a word everybody outside of the art world uses constantly, to say something feels important. And if artists will not commit to saying they deal with truth, how can anyone belief what they are dealing with has anything of importance?
