There are two ways in which I understand or have a productive view on culture and code. That is to say that I have the outskirts of a model that could apply to both.

From an extreme distance we have the view of a network which is a distributed structure, or peer to peer structure, finding its application in distributed versioning and restful web services. This is a model which so accurately mirrors the nature of culture,that it will be very productive to apply these models to the description of culture or the production thereof.

Then on the other hand we have on the smallest possible level (which is of course in an abstract way the biggest or most overarching), the theory of computation. I think computation is what goes on in our mind, therefore it makes a lot of sense to describe the world not in facts, but in functionsâ€”or at least equations. The discrepancies between traditional mathematics and the theory of computation will provide an excellent framework for trying to accomplish this.

Note to self: there you have it. Now just do it.

[Speaker Unknown] there is two ways in which I understand or have a productive view on culture and code that is to say that I have the outskirts of a model which could apply to both and from an extreme distance we have the view of a network which is a distributed structure or peer to peer structure finding its application in distributed versioning and restful web services this is a model which so accurately mirrors the nature of culture and that it will be very productive to apply these models to the description of culture or the production thereof then on the other hand we have on the smallest possible level which is of course in an abstract way the biggest or most overarching the theory of computation I think nondeterministic computation is what goes on in our mind therefore it makes a lot of sense to describe the world not in facts but in functions or at least equations the discrepancies between traditional mathematics and the theory of computation will provide an excellent framework for trying to accomplish this there you have it now just do it

[Speaker Unknown] no there is two ways to waste I understand four of the productive the U all in Coulter and Co B it is to say that outskirts of Ramallah which could apply to both B and b from one extreme to be distance we have have you been offbeat the network which is it distributes its structure or peer to peer structure B finding it's been the petition distribute it first name back and a restful wet surfaces this is a mall with so accurately the Mirror been the nature of culture and this will be very productive B two applying these models two Description of culture B B part of production narrow there has been on the other end all we have beyond the smallest both two levels which is of course in an abstract way the biggest our most over arching the theory of computation B B B I think been the only true in this state one tradition this what goes on back in our minds therefore it makes a lot of sense been to describe the world's be held in facts the team functions or at least equations B the discrepancies between traditional aftermath six and a theory of competition will provides an accident framework for trying to accomplish that B there you have it be be B now it just do it's been

nondeterministic -> the only true in this state
aftermath six -> mathemtaics

[Speaker 0] no there is two ways to waste I understand four of the productive 
[Speaker 1] the U 
[Speaker 2] all in Coulter and Co B 
[Speaker 3] it is to say that outskirts of Ramallah which could apply to both 
[Speaker 4] B and b 
[Speaker 0] from one extreme to be distance we have have you 
[Speaker 5] been offbeat the network 
[Speaker 6] which is it distributes its structure or peer to peer structure 
[Speaker 4] B 
[Speaker 0] finding it's been the petition distribute it first name back 
[Speaker 3] and a restful wet surfaces this is a mall with so 
[Speaker 0] accurately the Mirror been the nature of culture 
[Speaker 8] and this will be very 
[Speaker 9] productive B 
[Speaker 0] two applying these models two Description of culture B B 
[Speaker 10] part of production narrow there 
[Speaker 11] has been on the other end all we have 
[Speaker 13] beyond the smallest both two levels which 
[Speaker 0] is of course in an abstract way the biggest 
[Speaker 14] our most over arching the theory of computation 
[Speaker 15] B B B 
[Speaker 16] I think been 
[Speaker 0] the only true in this state one tradition this what goes on back 
[Speaker 17] in our minds therefore 
[Speaker 0] it makes a lot of sense been to describe the world's be held in facts the team functions or at least equations B 
[Speaker 14] the discrepancies between traditional aftermath six and a theory of competition will provides an accident framework for trying to accomplish that
