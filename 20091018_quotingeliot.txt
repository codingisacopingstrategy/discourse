If there is one thing I learned from the programmers, it is their complete disregard for the boundaries between high and low culture. Now this may sound like an artistic cliché of the 1990ies, but that is not true. Because for most artists and designers refering to popular culture or the vernacular has in some way been a statement. Saying to their colleagues something like ‘here, you pretentious twits, look at the beauty of the everyday and stop masquerading’. As if the everyday needs some kind of defense against snobism.

 Programmer Jerry Wall quotes Nietzsche and ‘The Hobbit’ in the same paragraph. 

This works the other way around. I would have been afraid of quoting, say, T.S. Eliot. As it signifies ‘high culture’. And if I am not going to testify of that beauty, who will? It is not as if there is an whole army of snobs constantly bothering everybody about T.S. Eliot.
