I started seeing movies in my head after I did not die.

My mind can be very bleak. I refer to where I am now as: "after the Gold Rush".

Facing two doctors who say me thinking I understand my situation is a sign of sickness. Realizing here we have a situation I will not be able to talk my way out of.  And

never knowing such a complete negation of the subject to be possible. Confronted with the survival mechanisms of my brain.

Cringing on the bathroom floor. First thought: identification with the unhappy artist. Second thought: I understand how the unhappy artist comes about, through the very categories that constitute bourgeois society: solid distinctions between normal and abnormal, sick and healthy, sane and insane.  Third thought:  an intense feeling of something rising in me to meet this. I understand the primal sentiments of the lust for vengeance, and how defiance is at the core of being. For identity, your ideas about who you are, can be taken away in an instant. But your feeling of me is a lot more superficial than your feeling of self. And that is what takes over, there is something in you that cannot be negated. It is the survival instinct of the brain. It is the impossibility of death in the mind of someone living. And I've found myself saying: "well I canâ€™t live that way". with no intention to die. And at that same time feeling that energy being so absolute that I could well imagine someone killing him or herself because of its negation. You see, I think we want to die because we don't want this life. We want another. Which is not to say we want to die, because death does not only end this life, it ends the possibility of another.

There are only two ages, I wrote, 17 and 24. At 17 you start to think you understand the world. At 24 you perform one last driven attempt with the whole of her being to reestablish this understanding: a consistent worldview that accommodates the makes and.

Asked plasticity of your brain sets in in the decades that follow you acquire a remarkable new capacity. In. You become much more adept at accepting incongruities. While from a romantic perspective this might seem like giving in, it certainly is as stands and which is more in line with the nature of nature, or life itself -- or so it seems. Nevertheless the energy dad is generated in the brain of a 24-year-old trying to produce structure, it is beyond compare. Though it lacks by far the wisdom of the decades that follow in its purer capacity for relentless abstraction fueled by the desire for meaning, it is truly a once in a lifetime event. This is shown by mathematicians and pop musicians, who both tend to peek around this age. Apparently, in both professions absolutist desire is more important than wisdom. Unlike in puberty, where the mind is content with feeling it is right, the 24-year-old mind is desperately trying to assert itself, faced with the worlds overwhelming on compliance with its structure and the growing certainty of its own demise, in death.
