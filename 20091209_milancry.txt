I was standing at the train station of Milan and a photographer was taking pictures of me. We tried out a variety of poses. I hadn’t slept much, and all the input of travelling and working and people added to *. I felt like I could cry. So I said: is it OK if I cry? Which, when you think about it, is a strange question. Sure, said the photographer. So I cried. And it was as if I had found the right switch, because the photographer suddenly made many pictures after each other.

The nicest place was in the back of the taxi with the model. 
So I said where do these rockstars meet up with these models, anyway? Do they just sit at the runway and pick them out? Well no, the visagist said, it’s more like you go to the same kind of clubs *. Yeah, added the model, it is like if you own a good club you want to provide quality, and quality is beatiful people, and models are beatiful people. When I lived in Greece someone of the agency would call each weekend and ask if we wanted to go out.
I think I like the way the world works, I thought.

To which I can add, the photographers assistant had a nice story as well. Friends of his were succesful event photographers. So now they started an event hall. And you could get a nice package deal when you hired both the hall and the photographers for your event. Which made me think, if these photographers were in charge, surely this hall must have been built with the photographs you could take in it in mind. An event hall designed for the photos of the event. Great.
