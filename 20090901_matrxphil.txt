It reminds me of an interview I read with this woman programming a film festival

‘But in contemporary popular culture there is a surprising amount of depth

Movies like the Matrix spark philosophical debates on internet forums’

Which makes you wonder whether she actually saw the movie

For it’s point seems to be ‘what if what we believe to be real is not real’

Fair enough. But than the plot revolves around breaking out of unrealness

Setting firm step in the real reality

Which is univocaly accepted by all characters as real

Even if they have all reason to doubt its reality

Since the last reality turned out fake.


Funny thing is, one reality turning out fake did not affect the characters full confidence in the realness of the next one
