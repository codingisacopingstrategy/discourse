You are allowed to use drugs, even encouraged to do so, if you use them to better mold yourself into the * image of the *.

Media are fragmented. If one newspaper wrote about Dylan all newspapers wrote about Dylan. If one record label wanted to sign the grateful dead, all record labels wanted to sign the Grateful Dead.

By presupposing art and economy are mutually exclusive artists forego the chance of bringing their vision and crazyness into economic models, thereby allowing a monoculture in economic models to persist.

I said to a friend, I will have a revolution, and it will be a meta revolution. I will revolutionize by showing how revolutions work. It will be the first revolution to go open source. ‘That’s funny’ she said. ‘You say it is the first revolution, which implies there will be more afterwords. But normally revolutions have it as their goal to be final.’

Meanwhile, in the United States, two un. Bob Dylan *. 

Now on the continent we have had nearly three decades of poststructural thought. That should be a good thing, because our world *is* rhizomatic and pluralistic and it is good to have models that point that out. It is a bad thing, as long as you can not explain non-philosophers what that means and why it matters. Meanwhile we grow up in pop culture. My English constructed surfing and reading blogs. The Anglosaxon culture of public rhetorics. And, in the past years, an intense interest in both Andy Warhol and Bob Dylan. Prince and David Bowie.

Sartre

Stranglehold of marxism** on intellectual life in progressive Europe. Foucault was actually the first * to give up his membership of the Marxist party.

I guess this generation is the first generation of continental intellectuals that has the potential to free itself from the stranglehold of marxist thought. It has consistently acted as capitalisms *, * Never found a real way of dealing with the rise of mass media and the lack of revolt of the people. In art, Adorno thought popular culture to be nothing but a means of controlling the masses.*This is one myth I would like to dispell* No one is in control, and no one can tell where the truth will pop up.

**03-10 of marxist politics, not marxism

**Obviously just an example of the way. Natural variations in temparament that also cause us to be artists * When I got attributed my second mental disorder I said stop. The director of an amsterdam medical clinic for musicians and dancers says one in four of his patients has attention hyperactivity disorder. He says we might want to be thankful of these people as opposed to regarding them as merely problematic. I liked that. But an american psychiatrist says we could save society money by screening for suspect adhd infants at health centres, start their medication early so the changes of them quitting on an adult age are diminished.

Because when you are fiery and passionate and you start thinking about ‘the world’, there are only two possible outcomes: either the world is going to end, or you will go and save the world (of course they come from a similar thougt pattern: in both cases the world need saving). Because I am optimistic I choose the last option. And I try very hard to rein in this emotion, because the world as such is not something you can deal with. You can also be fiery and passionate in your thinking and being *: in fact that is the more healthy option. The only reason for absolutist thought is anxiety.nsetad of saying i changed the world, you could say i wrote a poem.

Nietzche says our sense for history * when you can witness the actual construction of history. We are actually contemplating how the future will look at our time.
