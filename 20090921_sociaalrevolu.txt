Now on the continent we have had nearly three decades of poststructural thought. That should be a good thing, because our world *is* rhizomatic and pluralistic and it is good to have models that point that out. It is a bad thing, as long as you can not explain non-philosophers what that means and why it matters. Meanwhile we grow up in pop culture. My English constructed surfing and reading blogs. The Anglosaxon culture of public rhetorics. And, in the past years, an intense interest in both Andy Warhol and Bob Dylan. Prince and David Bowie.

The only reason for absolutist thought is anxiety.nsetad of saying i changed the world, you could say i wrote a poem.
