[Speaker Unknown] thus the answer the key the key she that kick the structure of language so basically every word that said that is said to exist and so it is and what that is it is to defend him there are only two kinds of words works my words works like a bar Steve dysfunction is a word Bush's says groups they weren't in it says it's worth it and then you have the basic sentence what are the free concert for it now words for words worked they are worse for wear it it's no words for words everything so far no court everything there a word like these that Ah for the word word that word P call it press Oh and for no words is there a word like are Phoenix I think I mean the Navy one parents are nine in which it most Carol Lin and refers to itself the most precise this is that briefing all one word it's infinite if you say these days everything you see them this sentence would be a self contained universe it would be true however if the universe will consist of some more sentences it would at first dollars be enough to be you could have a sentence that says this is everything you could have a sentence that says I am briefing php and the sentence that this is everything SEN since that time everything it would seem to be mutually mutually the district but that is not the case because that is not how to work its functions because basically what the word is means it is like and I am a reef it's very much this is everything being in South Florida State the meeting but we see that in this is everything the Senate to speak stuff itself and first person he is heating up as a first person and I and every game the sentence speaks of itself first there are days to ship is an allergist and that's basically don't read it in there if you weren't B and that's I'll make a bigger sentences works also because I mean the facts that kind of words like it but that there would also fall to words like and or or and I can't you see and what did or is mostly seemed to be inclusive that to me if you stay if it's true or not it's true it is possible both be true I'll read it tensions and I think what is true in there and which won't start early and will you know first four IC the series this course of the tulips this weekend after this everything is true because they are for sexiest name the declarations he came to its distance eight and the specific thing would be more and these weren't the function to generate meaning um but semantics he yelled maybe not it's hurting um one of the main things I have figured out but very eerie on this that everything is true and that soundtrack huge hit and only if you think the word everything for you but I'm and that that system a motive if if if Kurtz If reasoning that you actually are you all you are not constructing a very intricate clashes of things with thigh you see it use the varying two fell you know your chest it's just that but it's been caving to complaining that roof for your illegal for four door Ford was taken to present them the main point is that I forgot the name to remember name is that there's four suits basic rule budget which says two things cannot be true same time and I think that's the biggest fallacy CIA the bicoastal motion fact that it seeks to look at this is of course the biggest didn't it is to misunderstand me about ten weeks so I think or feel it's true at the same venue he did it look you are trying to assert when you speak and it goes to court to not seeing everything that's why everything so understood the message that the word and you're saying on the very specific it's a very specific amount of things and they are everything within their will then be among the things he's been saying but they're very specifically all the victims of the tube stop two this kid too long winded I'm yes litigation eyed evening kitchen it's assists well I think cysts and that's about and there but but it has no role no no no no in no more fundamental role and that's the only thing you did he actually there Nick it negates is itself because finding Geisha new spirit at a distance vacation when things start to hear that but the key beyond the thing about being gay but you won't still you need it to make it more beautiful anyhow semantics so does everything is through with the bunch with it has been banned at the end which is as this apologies since this incident those words basically and this has been in mind bring all along six months because it came to me it well what you could go Paula if you want it to block it but that was our reputation is key of course and that sent the fifth set to be kind enough to get this definition also a Kurd some very strange psycho psycho statement that the circumstances but still nothing and but at the loss they suffered think more about semantics and the eye that's where this function part comes into play at him and that's where I find out more now during their epic that stand forever and but I agreed to leave they're there the dead that almost no functional it is very interesting in this regard it's interesting work on the OK good and how that I read very interesting that because that s been shown to Inaudible in mathematical logic the buck P because love and if it was all our talks M but there have been the scientists to be seeing that and that the team is crucial that up with me for my staff that competition because it's refreshing and if it's refreshing it's a very interesting thing because I think for a person does not well Ari you're a person and because of course the whole difference between but tradition and to that mathematics yes well Wolf because mathematics of the skeptics them competition always has been good take a look makes those sorts of tools and backstopped Team ever further from the frontier I had taken one to conclude the opening of a few years are laying on the key moments of the U cf in them but the thing with competition is that in essence O'Neal told the specter of the time um so some will be the outcome of some workers to function and but you would see it's been said to be a vehicle character gets of course it all off very appropriate because programs no change at the causes of death the execution but in the Bay of course that's exactly what happens functions change because of that execution and I'm certain that is it then that's a costly process and the funny thing is if you would for a coercive process the side of the brain that would not he just circles to being over that would not be so circular the process well would you say to some extent of what is sure to be more of its advisory process Edm and that's what I think it's a flawed process at best for him some ethics that comes into play and but with the infected e-mail about the date set boy it's because it's if I just find the right concentration right Pappas has been in direct focus in and basically media rights and something we need it very easy to sit with them meaning and still do that B I wish it was a result it just feels like I could just say maybe five courts that would have well adjusted at its own but her ear on us at the ready this is something that you feel many more it's been streaming through your body anything else I remember a few months ago recording infection I feel that period right still a theory of everything streaming through life itself and it's pretty funny we'll be glad when he said I can work this to some of the circus justifiable thing and though it would be that it's a moral test and it's so not perfect but a function and the equations and then I think I would like to show that in the end result equations that it's an it's an equation that endeavor but pools the Dutchman never dissidents in two one MC It's remains in question and but that's not a hard fact it's a party switching the article A six Beckett speedy stats so six hundred
