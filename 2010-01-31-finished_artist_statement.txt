Artistâ€™s statement Eric SchrijverAt times I feel like I understand everything. It is surprising how little good that does in itself. I become enclosed in my self: truth is smaller than reality.I make characters who search for meaning. Meaning is what comes about when we understand. It is the process of understanding that I show.Meaning is a sensation we have, that can ocassionaly reach te ecstatic. Understanding is like a drug.I search for awesomeness, well my characters do, and I play my characters. The performances I do, the photographs I make, I want them to look awesome. I have to look awesome on them too.I have an intense interest in epistomology and mathematical linguistics, but talking about that only makes sense when I put on shiny pants.For me the shallow and profound are hard to distinguish.In my attempts to analyze my desire for awesomeness I get completely caught up in substantiating the desire. I think awesomeness is the modern day equivalent of the sublime.I believe in the looks of pop culture, because that is the culture I am a part of. I strive to be an active part of it. There is no way in which you can be a critical outsider. I believe as an artist you are always on the inside.The processes I show are often closed loops.
